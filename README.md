AR-U (Our University) is a mobile app project with the goals of making the UNR campus more discoverable. Using the AR interface users will be able to look at buildings on campus and identify key features. Are you a new student? then our app will help you locate your classes? Are you a returning student? Then our app will let you discover places to hang out, resources, restrooms, and other features at a glance! This app will help everyone from students to vistors discover more about the campus quickly with a single mobile app. Join us on this development.

Thank you for checking this project out.
